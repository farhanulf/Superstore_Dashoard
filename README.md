![Story 4](https://github.com/farhanulf/Superstore_Dashoard/blob/main/Story%204.png)
The Performance per State analysis was conducted to determine whether the number of employees significantly influences the sales volume in each state. Performance per State is calculated using the formula: Total sales per state / Total employees per state. From the Performance per State graph, several insights were obtained:
  1. A high number of employees does not guarantee high sales per state. This indicates that there are some employees whose performance is below average, leading to lower state performance in terms of sales.
  2. Based on point 1, this finding can serve as a background for implementing cost-efficiency measures in states with low performance as well as states with high sales.
